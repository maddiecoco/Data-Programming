Description: This program analyzes the dialogue of the first star wars
movie by sentiment score and creates visuals based on the results.

Most positive line:
Character:  BIGGS
Dialogue:  I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to 
be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work 
if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize 
commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely 
a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
Score:  5


Most negative line:
Character:  LEIA
Dialogue:  General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  
Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that 
I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has 
fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has 
failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion 
into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve 
it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our 
most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
Score:  -6
